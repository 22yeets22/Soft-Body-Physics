## Features  
- Simulates soft-body physics using point masses and springs.  
- Supports 2D physics with realistic deformation and elasticity.  
- Mouse interaction for dragging and manipulating objects.  
- Collision detection with walls. 
- Adjustable parameters for stiffness, damping, and gravity.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Pygame 2.0 or higher  

## Controls  
- **Left Mouse Button** - Drag points or objects.

## Customization  
Modify constants in `config.py` to tweak physics properties like gravity, damping, and stiffness.
